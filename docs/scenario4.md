# Scenario 4 - Down to you!

The last scenario is down to you to figure out!

Take a look at the [Cheatsheet](cheatsheet.md) to see the full list of the ayespy config.

We want to crop to just the burger menu list.

You will probably want to think about clicking on the burger menu first and maybe waiting for the menu to be displayed!

Feel free to use the nice ECSD folk around the room if you get stuck!

The selectors that you will be interested in are all here
